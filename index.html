    <h2>For You ❤️</h2>
    <p>Happy Valentine's Day to my precious girlfriend who is more important than the whole world cuz she IS my WHOLE WORLD 💗💗. I'm the luckiest guy in the whole world to have you in my life 🥹🧿💗💗. It's not easy for you to date a chatterbox like me but it's all your fault because you're a good listener and I love sharing my feelings with you, thank you for keeping up my stupidity and over excitement, it means the world to me and ik I have said this so many times but ANNOYING YOU IS MY FAVOURITE THING TO DO, it's kind of my love language now because every time you get mad at me I just wanna hold you in my arms and kiss you on your forehead to settle things down between us. I won't hold back loving you. 
I just wanted to tell you that your eyes are the reason why I feel loved. Your smile is the reason why I talk so much. Your touch is why I believe in God because I feel nothing less than being in heaven either when you hold me in your arms, hold my face to kiss me, rub my back when I'm not feeling good or yk... that. It is most of the time SOOOO ez for me to love you because it comes naturally but when the times are rough between us I would definitely do everything in my power to let you know that I love you with everything I have got 💗💗🫂
Thank you soooooo much for doing everything you do for me I couldn't ask for more. I love you so much baby 🫂💗💗🧿🧿<br>
    I also wanna let you know that I'm never busy for you, you have all my time, you never have to hesitate to talk to me about something even if it is hurtful for me, if it is bothering you then it is bothering us and the same goes with me too, we'll fix it together cuz I don't wanna lose you just because I felt bad about something that is temporary and yes everything is temporary except Us 🫂💗🧿🧿.</p>
